This Program Imitates bubbles created via a particle system.

The bubbles go toward the surface and grow and shrink based on a noise function within the particle system.

There is a bubble sound playing in the background that effects the size of the word 'Bubbles!' in the background of the scene, and a shader controls the background color.
